# ACME TRADER CLIENT

This is a front end client built with ReactJs that will connect to the api served using the project at:
    
    https://github.com/ballerkobe808/acme-api.git

It lists currencies at https://www.kraken.com/help/api#public-market-data that have matching USD pairs.
It grabs current relevant trade data and displays them in graphical format. It also polls at a user specified frequency for the most up to date information
